# Issue #1: Watchlist Management Planning

## Summary
Implement a watchlist management feature that allows users to add movies to a watchlist, view their watchlist on a dedicated page, and manage their watchlist items. The implementation should include UI indicators, a dedicated page, and local storage persistence.

## Requirements
- [x] Create local storage persistence service for watchlist
- [x] Implement add to watchlist functionality
- [x] Implement remove from watchlist functionality
- [x] Create watchlist indicator on movie cards
- [x] Add watchlist toggle on movie details page
- [x] Create dedicated watchlist page
- [x] Design and implement empty state for watchlist
- [x] Add appropriate animations for list changes
- [x] Test feature thoroughly (including persistence)

## Current State Assessment
After reviewing the codebase, I've found that:

1. The storage service (storage.service.ts) already had watchlist functionality implemented including:
   - `getWatchlist()`
   - `addToWatchlist()`
   - `removeFromWatchlist()`
   - `isInWatchlist()`

2. There was a route defined for the watchlist page in routes.constants.ts (`WATCHLIST: '/watchlist'`)

3. The App.tsx file had a route for the watchlist, but it was using a placeholder component

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Tasks

1. **Enhanced Storage Service**
   - Added custom event dispatching for watchlist updates to ensure UI syncs across multiple components
   - Exported StoredMovie type for reuse in other components

2. **Created WatchlistButton Component**
   - Implemented a reusable component with both button and icon variants
   - Added proper TypeScript types and props
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for the component

3. **Updated Existing Components**
   - Updated MovieCard component to use the new WatchlistButton
   - Updated MovieDetailsPage to use the new WatchlistButton

4. **Created WatchlistPage**
   - Implemented a dedicated page for browsing watchlisted movies
   - Added empty state for when the watchlist is empty
   - Implemented proper event handling for real-time updates across the app
   - Created unit tests for the page

5. **Updated App Routing**
   - Connected the new WatchlistPage to the existing route

6. **Added Animations**
   - Added fade-in animation for the empty state
   - Added zoom-out animation when removing items from the watchlist
   - Implemented smooth transitions between states

### All Requirements Completed âœ…

The Watchlist Management feature has been successfully implemented, with all requirements from the original issue met. The feature now provides:

- Local storage persistence
- Add/remove functionality
- UI indicators on movie cards and details pages
- A dedicated watchlist page with responsive layout
- Empty state handling
- Smooth animations
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Future Enhancements (Beyond Current Scope)

1. **Filter/Sort Functionality**
   - Add ability to sort watchlist by title, date added, release date, etc.
   - Add ability to filter watchlist by genre or other criteria

2. **Batch Operations**
   - Add ability to select multiple movies and perform operations (remove, mark as watched)

3. **Export/Import Functionality**
   - Allow users to export their watchlist and import it later

## Notes on Implementation Decisions

1. **Custom Events for State Management**
   - Used custom events (`watchlistUpdated`) to sync UI state across components
   - This approach is simpler than implementing a global state management solution for this specific feature

2. **Component Composition**
   - Created a reusable WatchlistButton component to maintain consistent UI/UX
   - This reduces code duplication and makes future changes easier

3. **Type Safety**
   - Added proper TypeScript types throughout to catch errors at compile time
   - Fixed type issues between different parts of the application (MovieDetails vs. Movie)

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Watchlist Page
- Create a new WatchlistPage component with appropriate file structure
- Implement the watchlist UI showing all saved movies in a grid layout
- Add empty state when the watchlist is empty

### 2. Add Watchlist UI Components
- Create a WatchlistButton component for adding/removing from watchlist
- Add the button to movie cards and movie details page

### 3. Update Movie Card Component
- Add watchlist indicator/button to the MovieCard component
- Implement toggle functionality

### 4. Update Movie Details Page
- Add watchlist button to the movie details page
- Implement toggle functionality

### 5. Add Animations
- Add appropriate animations for adding/removing items from the watchlist

### 6. Testing
- Write tests for the watchlist functionality
- Test persistence across page refreshes

## Technical Approach
- Use the existing storage.service.ts for persistence logic
- Follow the project's file naming conventions (*.component.tsx, *.page.tsx)
- Use Material UI components for consistency with the rest of the application
- Use React Query for state management if applicable
- Implement proper error handling for storage operations
